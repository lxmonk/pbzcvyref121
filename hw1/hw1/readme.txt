THIS IMPLEMENTATION PROUDLY COMPUTES ANY ACKERMANN VALUE THAT IS
ACCURATELY CONTAINED INSIDE A C LONG INT, INCLUDING ACK(4,1)
AND ACK(3,28) - ON MY PC.


Being cognizant that academic dishonesty is an offense against the
regulations of the university, the faculty of natural sciences, the
department of computer science, and the compiler construction
course, we hereby assert that the work we submit for this assignment
is entirely our own. We have made no use of solutions and/or of
code from other students in the class, from students who took the
class in previous years, or from any other source outside the class
(e.g., a friend, the internet, etc). We realize that if we are suspected
of academic dishonesty, we shall be called before the disciplinary
committee (ועדת משמעת) and that the minimal penalty for
cheating on an assignment is a failing grade in the course.
We proudly and steadfastly maintain that this work is entirely and
only our own.
